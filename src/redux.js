// action, reducers, middleware, and the store,
// connect() function connects a React component to a Redux store.
// connects a React component with the Redux store.
// Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. You send them to the store using store.dispatch()
// dispatch
// to handle action we use reducer
// Redux can hold business logic inside its own layer (middleware),
// reducers produce the state of your application, state in Redux comes from reducers
// the only way to change the state is by sending a signal to the store. This signal is an action. So "dispatching an action"

// mapStateToProps function (you can name it also "select")
// a mapDispatchToProps function


// action constant?- > action -> reducer (key access) -> store ->  Component move state -> use in any component (dispatch)
